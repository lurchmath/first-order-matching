<!--
   -  This file is a simple illustration of the minimal use of the
   -  First Order Matching module in a WebWorker.
   -  It requires the first-order-matching.js script from this repository,
   -  as well as the openmath.js script from the following repository:
   -    https://github.com/lurchmath/openmath-js
   -  See the API documentation in this repository for details.

        <!--
           -  Import the OpenMath script so we can construct expressions.
           -  Although this script is available from a CDN, it is imported
           -  by the first-order-matching.js script below, and thus needs to
           -  be in this same folder anyway.
           -
           -  This file will not load successfully from this repository,
           -  however, because we do not keep in this repository a copy of
           -  openmath.js.  Users can fetch it from this link:

            // Tell the worker about a new matching problem:
            // Does 5 match 5?
            // (Answer: yes, of course, but more specifically, it does so
            // in exactly one way, and that way is with a metavariable
            // instantiation equal to the empty map.)
            W.postMessage( [ 'newProblem', 1, x.encode(), x.encode() ] );

            // As soon as this page is loaded, it should put some JSON into
            // the page representing this solution.  It will look like this:
            //   {"name":1,"solution":{},"count":1,"success":true}
            // See the API docs for information on each of those fields.
