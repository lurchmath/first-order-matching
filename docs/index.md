## Get started now

To import this code via a CDN or `npm`, check out the [API Reference
Page](api-reference.md).

## Background

[Unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science))
is an algorithm that takes two expressions that may contain metavariables
and produces an instantiation of the metavariables that would make the two
expressions equal.  Matching is a special case of unification in which only
one of the two expressions may contain metavariables.

## More Information

The following additional information is available in this documentation.

 * [Whitepaper](https://github.com/lurchmath/first-order-matching/blob/master/paper/first-order-matching-in-detail.pdf) - documents the capabilities and limitations of the algorithm in this repository, with proof of correctness
 * [Source Code](source-code.md) - see the source and/or import it into your
   own project
 * [API Reference](api-reference.md) - how to use the various functions and
   objects provided

More documentation may be added here in the future. For now you can [view this repository ![github](img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)](https://github.com/lurchmath/first-order-matching).
