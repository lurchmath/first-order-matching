## Background

[Unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science))
is an algorithm that takes two expressions that may contain metavariables
and produces an instantiation of the metavariables that would make the two
expressions equal.  Matching is a special case of unification in which only
one of the two expressions may contain metavariables.
